# Software Patterns Lab 🚀

**Software Patterns Lab** is an interactive webapp designed to help developers explore, visualize, and compare modern software architecture patterns. It provides a hands-on experience of how different architectures (N-Layered, Hexagonal, EDA, etc.) structure code, manage dependencies, and define testing strategies.

## 🎯 Our Objective

The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between architectural theory and implementation. Instead of just reading about patterns, users can:
- **Explore** real project structures (Java/Maven style) for various patterns.
- **Visualize** the flow of data and control between layers.
- **Analyze** dependency rules and coupling constraints.
- **Understand** testing strategies tailored specifically for each architecture.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Bundler**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Typography**: [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)
- **Styling**: Modern CSS (Variables, Flexbox, Grid)
